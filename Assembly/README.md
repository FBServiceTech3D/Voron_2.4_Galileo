**Mind that the Galileo Z-Drive components are by design of the author a TIGHT FIT**
Some pressing in of the bearings is expected and IMHO intended.

I try to describe here how i do assemble the Z-Drives (i did this already on two printers) and highlight some notes i took along the path of doing that

The connection to the Stepper motor is from the inside of the Z-Gear so you would need this done first...

1. Assemble the star gear onto the Stepper axle 
Mind that you have ~ 26 mm max of clearance to the carrier and you don't wanna hit it or be too far from it as you want good contact with the planetary
Use thread locker here !

2. Connect the Stepper motor to the GearBox with the four bolts from the Gearbox half 
Mind the orientation of the stepper wires (as you prefer it) and the Spacer/Hook
I use a drop of threadlock on the stepper M3 holes

3. Position the bearings
- Firstly the berings in the planetary gears simply snap (click) in place 
with a decise fingers squueze and those firmly remain in place. If those are either too hard to get in or too loose...not a good sign...calibrate printer

- Bearings in the front mount. I do press these in place with an M10 long allen key (a washer helps) and use the weight of my body over the large key to push along the perimeter of the bearing. After some convincing.. it gets in (and wont fall out or move.. ever)

- Bearing in the Z-drive case need some filing around the hole seam (it sits along the middle of the hole). After that is out of the way (cleareance is very tight) i use the same procedure as above (allen key / washer). Once the bearing is in place it shall be almost flush with the case surface

4. The Carriage GT2 pulley...yeah that one need definetly pressure...lot of it. I use a vise and once it is aligned properly i close it in. I remove some of the plastic which will form on the other end (at the top of the pulley exit) with a nail. It works well

5. Some filing of the shalfts may be involved as always due to pulleys/ bearings / shaft tolerances

Remember the **TWO (2) M5 x 1mm Shims** one on the inside of the Z-Gear and the other at the ouside before the Z-Belt pulley
Grease everitihg at your preference (i use just a smear of grease as you may notice...)

6. Mount the Z-Belt (9 mm) pulley - use thread locker

7. Assemble the Z-Gear to the front mount

That's about it

When it is assembled you shall see no gaps between parts and the Z-Belt pulley shall have an hair of a gap to the Mount bearing. If so you did well

Enjoy the Planetary gears !

(i hope the above was of any help)
