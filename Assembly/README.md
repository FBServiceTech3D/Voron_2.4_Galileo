**Mind that the Galileo Z-Drive components are by design of the author a TIGHT FIT**

Some pressing in of the bearings is expected and IMHO intended.
I used a long exagonal key driver (M10) to press them in by my body weight..

I try to describe here how i do assemble the Z-Drives (i did this already on two printers) and highlight some notes i took along the path of doing that

1. Firstly the berings in the planetary gears simply snap (click) in place with a decise fingers squueze and those firmly remain in place. 

2. Bearings in the front mount. I do press these in place with an M10 long allen key (a washer helps) and wait my body over the large key pushing along the perimeter. After some convincing it gets in (and wont fall out / move ever)

3. The bearing in the Z-drive case need some filing around the seam (it sits along the middle of the hole). After that is out of the way (cleareance is very tight) i use the same procedure as per point 2

4. The Carriage Gt2 pulley...yeah that one need definetly pressure...lot of it. I use a vise and once it is aligned properly i close it in. I remove some of the plastic which will form on the other end (at the top of the pulley exit) with a nail. It works well

5. Some filing of the shalfts may be involved as always due to pulleys/ bearings / shaft tolerances

That's about it

Enjoy

(i hope the above was of any help)
